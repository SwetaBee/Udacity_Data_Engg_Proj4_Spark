#### Project: Data Lake

## Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app

## Project Description
    
The knowledge of Spark and Data Lakes has been used to build an ETL pipeline for a Data Lake hosted on Amazon S3

In this task, we have to build an ETL Pipeline that extracts their data from S3 and process them using Spark and then load back into S3 in a set of Fact and Dimension Tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening. I have deployed this Spark process on a Cluster using AWS

## Project Datasets

Song Data Path --> s3://udacity-dend/song_data 
Log Data Path --> s3://udacity-dend/log_data 
Log Data JSON Path --> s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json

# Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset(https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example:

song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

# Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format. The log files in the dataset with are partitioned by year and month. For example:

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

And below is an example of what a single log file, 2018-11-13-events.json, looks like.

{"artist":"Pavement", "auth":"Logged In", "firstName":"Sylvie", "gender", "F", "itemInSession":0, "lastName":"Cruz", "length":99.16036, "level":"free", "location":"Klamath Falls, OR", "method":"PUT", "page":"NextSong", "registration":"1.541078e+12", "sessionId":345, "song":"Mercy:The Laundromat", "status":200, "ts":1541990258796, "userAgent":"Mozilla/5.0(Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4...)", "userId":10}

## Project Template

Project Template include three files:

1. etl.py reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark and writes them back to S3

2. dl.cfg contains AWS Credentials

3. README.md provides discussion on your process and decisions

## ETL Pipeline

Load the credentials from dl.cfg
Load the Data which are in JSON Files(Song Data and Log Data)
After loading the JSON Files from S3 use Spark process on this JSON files and generate a set of Fact and Dimension Tables


## Schema for Song Play Analysis

A Star Schema would be required for optimized queries on song play queries

# Fact Table

songplays - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

# Dimension Tables

users - users in the app user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

songs - songs in music database song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

artists - artists in music database artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude

time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday


## Run etl.py 

First, Fill in AWS acces key (KEY) and secret (SECRET).

Create an AWS S3 bucket.
Edit dl.cfg: add your S3 bucket name.
Copy log_data and song_data folders to your own S3 bucket.
Create output_data folder in your S3 bucket.
NOTE: You can also run script locally and use local input files. 
After installing python3 + Apache Spark (pyspark) libraries and dependencies, run from command line:

python3 etl.py (to process all the input JSON data into Spark parquet files.)


Script executes Apache Spark SQL commands to read source data (JSON files) from S3 to memory as Spark DataFrames.
In memory, data is further manipulated to analytics DataFrames.
Analytics dataFrames are stored back to S4 as Spark parquet files.
Script writes to console the query it's executing at any given time and if the query was successfully executed.
Script writes to console DataFrame schemas and show a handful of example data.
Script tells if whole ETL-pipeline was successfully executed.
Output: input JSON data is processed and analysed data is written back to S3 as Spark parquet files.
